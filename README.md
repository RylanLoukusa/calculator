# calculator

Spent around a week working on this project.

One of the main problems I had was trying to make the display size stay the same size. I had started with padding and margin and ended up switching to a flex based set display.

One issue that I did not complete, it was not required, was having the equal button redo the expression again. I left it as being unable to press the equal button without inputing another number or operation first
